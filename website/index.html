                                                                                  onto paper with an everyday drawing utensil. Our prototype will make use of four stepper motors in a rectangle,
                                                                                  each attached by wire to a harness in the center for the drawing utensil, to pull it around the surface.
                                                                                  The proccess will be controlled by a Raspberry Pi and have a camera attached to the harness for real-time feedback.</p>

                                                                                  by having each motor independent and capable of altering their placement, allowing for a range of sizes of the
